2. Widget Tests

test/widgets/welcome_screen_test.dart: Tests the welcome screen UI elements, theme options, and age selection.
test/widgets/story_screen_test.dart: Tests story display, navigation to the block workspace, and TTS controls.
test/widgets/block_workspace_test.dart: Tests adding blocks, toolbar functionality, drag-and-drop, and code execution.

3. Service Tests

test/services/gemini_story_service_test.dart: Tests AI story generation, error handling, and parameter validation.
test/services/storage_service_test.dart: Tests saving/retrieving stories and user settings.
test/services/tts_service_test.dart: Tests speech functionality, language settings, and callback registration.

4. Dependencies

Added pubspec.yaml with all required dependencies including:
