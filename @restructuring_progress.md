# Project Restructuring Progress

This document tracks the progress of restructuring and fixing the Kente Codeweaver project.

## Overall Progress

- [x] Initial project analysis
- [x] Identify critical components needing fixes
- [x] Fix block-related components (80% complete)
  - [x] Fixed Color.toArgb() and withOpacity deprecation issues
  - [x] Fixed JSON serialization issues
  - [x] Added mounted checks for BuildContext usage
  - [ ] Final verification of all block components
- [ ] Fix story-related components
- [ ] Implement missing services
- [ ] Comprehensive testing

## Detailed Progress

### Step 1: Project Analysis
- [x] Analyzed project structure and identified key components
- [x] Identified deprecated methods and syntax errors
- [x] Created plan for fixing components in priority order

### Step 2: Fix Block-Related Components
- [x] Fixed Color.toArgb() method in BlockWorkspace
  - Implemented manual calculation of ARGB values
  - Created _colorToHex method for proper color conversion
  - Fixed color conversion in multiple components
- [x] Fixed withOpacity deprecation
  - Replaced with withAlpha in BlockWorkspace class (0.3 → withAlpha(76))
  - Replaced with withAlpha in BlockWidget class (0.7 → withAlpha(178))
  - Replaced with withAlpha in PatternPainter class (0.1 → withAlpha(25))
- [x] Fixed JSON serialization issues
  - Added dart:convert import for JSON handling
  - Implemented proper encoding with jsonEncode for saving workspace data
  - Implemented proper decoding with jsonDecode for loading workspace data
  - Fixed template saving and loading functionality
- [x] Added mounted checks for BuildContext usage
  - Fixed potential issues in async methods that use BuildContext
  - Added proper error handling in try-catch blocks
  - Improved structure of asynchronous methods
- [x] Fixed template management functionality
  - Fixed template saving with proper JSON serialization
  - Fixed template loading with proper JSON parsing
  - Added error handling for template operations
  - Fixed UI feedback for template actions
- [ ] Verify all block-related components are functioning correctly

### Step 3: Fix Story-Related Components (Pending)
- [ ] Fix StoryScreen class
- [ ] Fix ChallengeService
- [ ] Fix Card components

### Step 4: Implement Missing Services (Pending)
- [ ] Implement AdaptiveLearningService
- [ ] Implement other missing services identified in the white paper

### Step 5: Testing (Pending)
- [ ] Test block workspace functionality
- [ ] Test story progression
- [ ] Test adaptive learning features

## Known Issues

1. Some components may still have deprecated methods that need to be identified and fixed
2. JSON serialization might need further improvements in other components
3. Need to verify all components work together correctly after individual fixes
4. Potential memory leaks in components with timers and animation controllers
5. Error handling could be improved in some async operations
6. Some UI components might need additional mounted checks for async operations

## Next Steps

1. Complete final verification of block-related components
   - Test BlockWorkspace functionality
   - Test template saving and loading
   - Test block connections and interactions
2. Move on to story-related components
   - Fix StoryScreen class
   - Fix ChallengeService
   - Fix Card components
3. Implement missing services
   - Implement AdaptiveLearningService
   - Implement other missing services identified in the white paper
4. Comprehensive testing of all fixed components
