# Project Restructuring Log

## Overview
This document tracks the restructuring of the Kente Codeweaver project (formerly Weave) from a type-based architecture to a feature-based architecture.

## Restructuring Process

### April 4, 2025

#### Migration Completion
- Completed the migration from type-based to feature-based architecture
- Created and executed scripts to move old files to the `@old/` directory for safekeeping
- Updated `main.dart` to use the new structure completely
- Created and executed scripts to update import statements in all migrated files
- Fixed migration issues by removing old directories from `/lib` folder
- Verified that only the new structure remains in `/lib`
- Excluded `@old/` directory from syntax error checking in `analysis_options.yaml`
- Added `@old/` directory to `.gitignore` to prevent tracking

#### New Structure
```
lib/
├── core/
│   ├── models/
│   ├── navigation/
│   ├── services/
│   ├── theme/
│   ├── utils/
│   └── widgets/
├── features/
│   ├── badges/
│   ├── blocks/
│   ├── block_workspace/
│   ├── challenges/
│   ├── cultural_context/
│   ├── engagement/
│   ├── home/
│   ├── learning/
│   ├── patterns/
│   ├── settings/
│   ├── storytelling/
│   └── welcome/
```

#### Import Updates
- Updated all import statements to reference the new structure
- Fixed cross-feature dependencies
- Ensured proper encapsulation of feature-specific code

#### Benefits of New Structure
- Improved code organization and maintainability
- Better separation of concerns
- Easier to understand feature boundaries
- More scalable for future development
- Facilitates feature-based team assignments

### March 25, 2025

#### Syntax Error Fixes
- Fixed all critical syntax errors in the codebase
- Created missing files and components
- Updated constructors to use super.key syntax
- Fixed BuildContext usage across async gaps
- Properly initialized fields in constructors
- Fixed method signatures and overrides
- Added missing parameters
- Fixed nullable value handling
- Updated Map access to use bracket notation

#### Analysis Results
- No critical errors remain in the codebase
- 95 warnings about unused imports, unreachable switch defaults, etc.
- 25 info messages about code style and best practices
- The app should now compile and run without syntax errors

## Next Steps
- Test the application to ensure it works with the new structure
- Fix any issues that arise during testing
- Address the remaining warnings and info messages in a future refactoring effort
- Document the new architecture for future developers
