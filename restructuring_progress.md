# Kente Codeweaver Project Restructuring Progress

## Overview
This document tracks the progress of restructuring the Kente Codeweaver project (formerly Weave) from a type-based architecture to a feature-based architecture. It serves as a historical record of the steps taken and decisions made during the restructuring process.

## Initial Assessment (Current State)

### Project Structure
- The project is in the process of being restructured from a type-based organization to a feature-based organization
- Both old and new structures currently coexist in the codebase
- Migration script (`migrate_project.ps1`) has been created and appears to have been partially executed

### Key Files
- `main.dart` - Current entry point, already using some of the new structure
- `main_with_new_structure.dart` - New entry point for the fully restructured application
- `migrate_project.ps1` - PowerShell script to automate the migration process
- `new_structure_migration_guide.md` - Documentation for the migration process

### Directory Structure
Current directories in `/lib`:
- `core/` (new structure)
  - `models/`
  - `navigation/`
  - `services/`
  - `theme/`
  - `utils/`
  - `widgets/`
- `features/` (new structure)
  - `badges/`
  - `blocks/`
  - `block_workspace/`
  - `challenges/`
  - `cultural_context/`
  - `engagement/`
  - `home/`
  - `learning/`
  - `patterns/`
  - `settings/`
  - `storytelling/`
  - `welcome/`
- `models/` (old structure)
- `navigation/` (old structure)
- `painters/` (old structure)
- `providers/` (old structure)
- `screens/` (old structure)
- `services/` (old structure)
- `theme/` (old structure)
- `widgets/` (old structure)

### Current Status
- The migration appears to be well underway
- The `main.dart` file is already importing from the new structure
- Key components like `AppRouter` and `ServiceLocator` have been implemented in the new structure
- The welcome screen has been migrated to the new structure

## Restructuring Plan
The following steps will be taken to complete the restructuring:

1. **Verify Migration Progress**: Check which files have been migrated and which still need to be moved
2. **Complete Migration**: Run the migration script again or manually move remaining files
3. **Update Import Statements**: Ensure all import statements in migrated files reference the new structure
4. **Resolve Dependencies**: Fix any missing dependencies or broken references
5. **Test the New Structure**: Ensure the application runs correctly with the new structure
6. **Clean Up**: Remove old files and directories once the new structure is verified

## Progress Log

### April 3, 2025
- Created this progress tracking document
- Analyzed the current state of the project
- Identified that significant progress has already been made in the migration
- Found that `main.dart` is already using some components from the new structure
- Discovered that key infrastructure like `AppRouter` and `ServiceLocator` are in place
- Determined that the welcome screen has been successfully migrated
- Ran the migration script to ensure all files are copied to the new structure
- Verified that all key screens exist in the new structure:
  - `welcome_screen.dart`
  - `home_screen.dart`
  - `block_workspace_screen.dart`
  - `settings_screen.dart`
  - `story_screen.dart`

### April 4, 2025
- Completed the migration process
- Created and executed a script to move old files to the `@old/` directory for safekeeping
- Updated `main.dart` to use the new structure completely
- Verified that the application now uses the feature-based architecture
- Confirmed that the app router and service locator are properly set up
- Identified import issues in some migrated files that still reference the old structure
- Created scripts to update import statements in all migrated files:
  - `update_imports.ps1`: PowerShell script to update imports
  - `update_imports.bat`: Batch file wrapper for the PowerShell script
- Successfully ran the import update script
- Updated all import statements to reference the new structure
- Updated project documentation:
  - Added architecture details to `project_handover.md`
  - Created `restructuring_log.md` in the Memory Bank

## Final Status

### Completed Tasks
- ✅ Created new feature-based directory structure
- ✅ Migrated files from old structure to new structure
- ✅ Moved old files to `@old/` directory for safekeeping
- ✅ Updated `main.dart` to use the new structure
- ✅ Updated import statements in all migrated files
- ✅ Updated project documentation
- ✅ Removed old directories from `/lib` folder
- ✅ Verified that only the new structure remains in `/lib`
- ✅ Excluded `@old/` directory from syntax error checking in `analysis_options.yaml`
- ✅ Added `@old/` directory to `.gitignore` to prevent tracking

### Next Steps
- Test the application to ensure it works with the new structure
- Fix any issues that arise during testing
- Consider removing the `@old/` directory once the new structure is verified to be working correctly
