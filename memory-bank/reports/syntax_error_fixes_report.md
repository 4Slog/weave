## Analysis Results
After implementing all the fixes, a Flutter analysis was run on the codebase with the following results:
- **Critical Errors**: 0 (All resolved)
- **Warnings**: 95 (Non-critical issues like unused imports, unreachable switch defaults)
- **Info Messages**: 25 (Code style suggestions like using super parameters)

## Conclusion
All critical syntax errors have been successfully fixed, and the app should now compile and run without syntax errors. The remaining warnings and info messages are about code style and best practices, which can be addressed in future refactoring efforts if desired.

## Next Steps
1. Run the app to verify that it works correctly
2. Address the remaining warnings and info messages in a future refactoring effort
3. Add tests to ensure the fixed components work as expected
4. Document the changes for future developers
