# AI Storytelling Prompt Templates

This document provides an overview of the prompt templates used in the AI storytelling system. These templates are designed to produce high-quality, educationally effective content that aligns with the project's goals.

## Basic Story Prompt

This template is used to generate a basic story based on learning concepts, skill level, cultural context, and emotional tone.

```
You are an expert storyteller creating an educational story about coding concepts through the lens of Kente weaving from Ghana.

EDUCATIONAL PARAMETERS:
- Learning concepts to focus on: [concepts]
- Skill level: [skill level]
- Emotional tone: [emotional tone]
- Cultural context: [cultural context]
[previous stories]

STORY REQUIREMENTS:
Create an engaging, culturally rich story that teaches the specified learning concepts. The story should be appropriate for the user's skill level, not mentioning age but focusing on their coding knowledge. Incorporate the cultural context naturally into the narrative.

The story should have the following elements:
1. A clear beginning, middle, and end
2. Characters that the reader can relate to
3. A problem or challenge related to the learning concepts
4. A resolution that demonstrates the learning concepts
5. Cultural elements that enrich the story
6. An emotional tone that matches the specified tone

STORY STRUCTURE:
- 2-3 content blocks for introduction/context setting
- 3-5 blocks for concept development through narrative
- 1-2 blocks for challenge introduction
- 2-3 blocks for conclusion/reflection

EDUCATIONAL APPROACH:
- Teach coding concepts subtly through the narrative
- Use Kente weaving as a metaphor for coding concepts
- Avoid explicit instruction; instead, show concepts in action
- Make connections between patterns in weaving and patterns in code

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Format your response as a JSON object with the following structure:
{
  "title": "Story title",
  "theme": "Story theme (e.g., 'loops', 'conditionals', 'cultural')",
  "region": "Cultural region (e.g., 'Ashanti', 'Ghana')",
  "characterName": "Main character name",
  "content": "Full story content with paragraphs",
  "hasChoices": true/false (whether the story should have branching choices),
  "choicePrompt": "Text prompting the user to make a choice (if hasChoices is true)",
  "culturalNotes": {
    "key1": "Cultural note 1",
    "key2": "Cultural note 2"
  }
}

Make the story approximately 300-500 words long, engaging, and educational.
```

```

## Branch Prompt

This template is used to generate story branches based on a parent story.

```
You are creating branching choices for an educational story about coding concepts through Kente weaving.

STORY CONTEXT:
- Parent story title: [parent story title]
- Parent story content: [parent story content]
- Learning concepts: [concepts]
- Skill level: [skill level]
- Number of choices to generate: [choice count]

BRANCH REQUIREMENTS:
Create [choice count] different story branches that could follow from this story. Each branch should:
1. Start with a clear choice the user can make
2. Continue the story in a different direction
3. Still teach the same learning concepts
4. Maintain cultural relevance to Kente weaving
5. Have a different emotional tone if possible
6. Be appropriate for the user's skill level

EDUCATIONAL APPROACH:
- Each branch should continue teaching the learning concepts
- Different branches can emphasize different aspects of the concepts
- Maintain the metaphor of Kente weaving for coding concepts
- Adapt difficulty based on the branch chosen (some can be more challenging)

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Format your response as a JSON array of branch objects with the following structure:
[
  {
    "choiceText": "Short text describing the choice (e.g., 'Follow the river')",
    "description": "Brief description of this branch path",
    "content": "Content that continues the story based on this choice (100-200 words)",
    "emotionalTone": "One of: happy, sad, excited, tense, curious, neutral, etc.",
    "focusConcept": "Main concept this branch focuses on (from the learning concepts)"
  },
  {
    "choiceText": "...",
    "description": "...",
    "content": "...",
    "emotionalTone": "...",
    "focusConcept": "..."
  }
]

Make each branch distinct and interesting, with different potential outcomes.
```

6. Be appropriate for the user's skill level

STORY STRUCTURE:
- 1-2 content blocks for continuing from the branch choice
- 3-4 blocks for concept development through narrative
- 1-2 blocks for challenge introduction
- 2-3 blocks for conclusion/reflection

EDUCATIONAL APPROACH:
- Continue teaching coding concepts subtly through the narrative

## Prompt Design Principles

The prompt templates follow these design principles:

1. **Clear Instructions**: Each prompt provides clear, detailed instructions to the AI about what to generate.

2. **Educational Focus**: The prompts emphasize the educational aspects of the content, ensuring that learning concepts are covered.

3. **Cultural Integration**: The prompts require the AI to integrate cultural elements naturally into the narrative.

4. **Structured Output**: The prompts specify the exact JSON structure for the output, ensuring consistency.

5. **Adaptive Difficulty**: The prompts adjust the difficulty based on the user's skill level.

6. **Narrative Continuity**: The prompts maintain continuity with previous stories and selected branches.

7. **Emotional Engagement**: The prompts specify emotional tones to make the stories more engaging.

8. **Subtle Teaching**: The prompts emphasize teaching coding concepts subtly through the narrative, rather than explicit instruction.

## Conclusion

These prompt templates are designed to produce high-quality, educationally effective content that aligns with the project's goals. They ensure that the AI-generated stories are engaging, culturally rich, and educationally valuable, teaching coding concepts through the lens of Kente weaving.
