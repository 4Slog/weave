# Performance Optimization Implementation

## Overview

Implemented comprehensive performance optimization for the Kente Codeweaver application, focusing on:

1. **Memory Management**: Adaptive cache sizing, selective cache invalidation, and memory monitoring
2. **Offline Capabilities**: Robust offline experience with synchronization capabilities
3. **Asset Optimization**: Efficient asset loading, caching, and memory usage
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Tracking and analyzing app performance metrics

## Key Components

### Memory Management

- **EnhancedStorageService**: Extended storage service with adaptive cache sizing, priority-based caching, memory pressure monitoring, and selective cache invalidation
- **AIContentManager**: Specialized memory management for AI-generated content with content-type specific caching, usage-based retention, and expiration policies

### Offline Capabilities

- **SynchronizationService**: Handles data synchronization with pending operations queue, conflict resolution, and background synchronization
- **OfflineModeHandler**: Manages offline mode behavior with connectivity monitoring, offline mode preparation, and feature availability determination

### Asset Optimization

- **AssetManager**: Low-level asset management with asset caching, memory-efficient loading, and critical asset preloading
- **OptimizedAssetLoader**: High-level asset loading with downsampled image loading, batch preloading, and feature-based preloading

### Performance Monitoring

- **PerformanceMonitorService**: Tracks app performance with frame rate monitoring, memory usage tracking, and operation timing
- **PerformanceOverlayWidget**: Visual overlay for performance monitoring with real-time metrics and report generation

## Implementation Details
