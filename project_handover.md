# Project Handover Document: Kente Codeweaver

## Project Overview
Kente Codeweaver is an AI-powered educational application targeted at children aged 7-15. The application's primary goal is to teach coding through culturally immersive storytelling inspired by traditional Ghanaian Kente weaving. The platform combines adaptive AI-driven storytelling, interactive coding challenges, and extensive multimedia assets to provide a personalized and engaging learning experience.

## Objectives
- Teach fundamental coding concepts including loops, conditionals, functions, and debugging.
- Incorporate African cultural heritage through interactive Kente weaving pattern generation.
- Utilize AI for adaptive learning experiences and dynamic storytelling.
- Support multilingual learning environments.
- Provide limited offline functionality relying solely on cached content.

## Technical Stack
- Frontend: Flutter (Dart)
- State Management: Provider
- AI Integration: Google Gemini AI (flutter_gemini)
- Local Storage: Hive & SQLite
- Multimedia: Flutter TTS, audio, and visual assets
- Future Integration: Firebase for user authentication and cloud progress tracking

## Project Architecture
The project follows a feature-based architecture, which organizes code by feature rather than by type. This approach improves maintainability, scalability, and separation of concerns.

- Conduct a detailed analysis of the current state of the application against the intended feature set outlined above.
- Identify existing gaps and issues, including previously documented syntax errors.
- Assess the effectiveness and clarity of the existing code structure.
- Develop and propose an improved, modular, and maintainable file and code structure.

## Critical Errors Previously Identified
The team should reference the provided documentation (critical_errors.md) for a list of known critical syntax errors requiring immediate attention.

## Recommended Next Steps
- Perform a comprehensive audit of the current codebase and documentation.
- Create a detailed project roadmap addressing the identified gaps and areas needing improvement.
- Propose enhancements to the current file and code structure to enhance maintainability and scalability.
- Develop an actionable implementation plan, including timelines and milestones for the completion of remaining features.

## Resources
- Access to the complete Git repository including commit history.
- API keys and environment variables located in the .env file.
- Assets located under the directories `assets/audio`, `assets/images`, and `assets/data`.
- Existing documentation provided, acknowledging that some documents may require updates.

## Suggested Timeline for Initial Assessment
- Week 1: Complete audit of existing code and documentation.
- Week 2: Gap analysis between current state and intended feature set.
- Week 3: Proposal for improved structure and detailed implementation roadmap.
