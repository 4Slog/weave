# Project Handover Document

## Project Overview
This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Kente Codeweaver project, a visual programming environment designed to teach coding concepts through African cultural patterns, particularly Kente cloth designs.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into several key features:
- Block Workspace: The core visual programming environment
- Storytelling: Narrative elements that provide context and guidance
- Learning: Adaptive learning components and skill progression
- Authentication: User management and progress tracking
- Core Services: Shared utilities and services used across features

## Recent Fixes and Improvements

### Block-Related Components
1. Fixed Color.toArgb() method in BlockWorkspace by implementing a manual calculation of ARGB values:
   ```dart
   String _colorToHex(Color color) {
     final int a = (color.a * 255).round();
     final int r = (color.r * 255).round();
     final int g = (color.g * 255).round();
     final int b = (color.b * 255).round();
     final int argb = (a << 24) | (r << 16) | (g << 8) | b;
     return '#${argb.toRadixString(16).padLeft(8, '0').substring(2).toUpperCase()}';
   }
   ```

2. Fixed withOpacity deprecation by replacing it with withAlpha in multiple classes:
   - BlockWorkspace class
   - BlockWidget class
   - PatternPainter class

   Example of replacement:
   ```dart
   // Before
   color: Colors.black.withOpacity(0.3)

   // After
   color: Colors.black.withAlpha(76) // 0.3 * 255 = 76
   ```

3. Fixed JSON serialization issues in BlockWorkspace by implementing proper encoding/decoding of workspace data:
   - Added dart:convert import
   - Implemented proper JSON encoding/decoding for saving and loading workspaces
   - Fixed template saving and loading functionality

   Example of JSON serialization fix:
   ```dart
   // Before
   await _storageService.saveSetting(
     'workspace_${widget.userId}_${widget.challengeId}',
     workspace
   );

   // After
   final workspaceJson = jsonEncode(workspace);
   await _storageService.saveSetting(
     'workspace_${widget.userId}_${widget.challengeId}',
     workspaceJson
   );
   ```

4. Added mounted checks to prevent using BuildContext after async gaps:
   - Fixed potential issues in async methods that use BuildContext
   - Added proper error handling in try-catch blocks
   - Improved structure of asynchronous methods

   Example of mounted check:
   ```dart
   // Before
   ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(...);

   // After
   if (mounted) {
     ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(...);
   }
   ```

5. Fixed template loading functionality:
   - Added proper JSON parsing for templates
   - Improved error handling in template operations
   - Fixed UI feedback for template actions

## Development Guidelines

### File Management
- When migrating files, move old files to the @old/ directory rather than deleting them
- Utilize code from @old/ directories to fix errors rather than reinventing functionality
- Ensure @lib/ directory contains only actively used files

### Development Process
- Fix code errors incrementally without running the app until all critical errors are resolved
- When implementing missing features, first check @old and old directories for existing implementations
- Fix block-related components first, followed by story-related components

## Next Steps
1. Complete final verification of block-related components
   - Test BlockWorkspace functionality
   - Test template saving and loading
   - Test block connections and interactions
2. Move on to story-related components
   - Fix StoryScreen class
   - Fix ChallengeService
   - Fix Card components
3. Implement missing services
   - Implement AdaptiveLearningService
   - Implement other missing services identified in the white paper
4. Comprehensive testing of all fixed components

## Known Issues
1. Some components may still have deprecated methods that need to be identified and fixed
2. JSON serialization might need further improvements in other components
3. Need to verify all components work together correctly after individual fixes
4. Potential memory leaks in components with timers and animation controllers
5. Error handling could be improved in some async operations
6. Some UI components might need additional mounted checks for async operations
